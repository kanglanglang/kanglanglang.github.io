## Start from here...    

> What is conversation?

![conversation](/img/in-post/HT-talk3.png)

 
Last week, I watched a Ted talk video titled "How to be a Good talker to other?". It is a very thought-provoking issue for youngers in nowaday.     
 
You know, This video attracted me because I'm actually a talking weaker, Yeah, I'm so suck when talking to people. For years I try to be more      

positive while having a conversation with other. Like, ask questions, behave more paying attention, look into their eyes as listening......     

But, it is not working. Sometimes some conversations make me awkward, unsafe, confused...And I believe many many people have the same feeling of mine.       

>people become less and less good at having  great conversations with other Nowaday.     

This ted talk speaker show our some facks about people's skill of conversation are becoming weaker and weaker. Techology may be guilt for that in some way.     

Accroding a research, shows that about a thrid of American teenagers send more than a hundred texts a day and many of them, almost most of them,are more likely      

to text their friends than they are to talk to them face to face. This tendency is not good.     

> So let's pay more attention to "How to become a good talker while talking to people face to face?".

I fully believe we all have that experience that we made ourself jump into the moment which lets us feel engaged and inspired.   

or which make us feel like we've made a real connection or we've been perfectly understood.

Unfortunately, many of times we lost that feelings(not for every one).  <b>We need to find a way to get it back!</b>       



## Here some tips she gives to us.

### Number one:  Don't multitask(三心二意).
Be present, Be in that moment. Don't think about your argument you had with your boss.Don't think about what you're going to have for dinner.     

If you want to get out of the conversation, get out of the conversation. <b>But don't be half in it and half out of it.</b>      
     
### Number two:  Don't pontificate(好为人师).     

If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument or pushback or growth,

> Write a blog! (just like I'm doing it right now)     

You need to enter every conversation assuming that you have something to learn.      

Sometimes that means setting aside your personal opinion. This acceptance, the speaker will become less and less vulnerable and more and more likely to       

open up the inner recesses of his or her mind to the listener.

### Number three: Use open-ended questions.      
In this case, take a cue from journalists. Start your questions with who,what,when,where,why or how.      

If you put in a complicated question,you're going to get a simple answer out. If I ask you, "Were you terrified?"    

you're going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence, and the answer is "Yes, I was" or "No,I wasn't."      

Let them describe it. They're the ones that know. Try asking them things like,"What was that like?","How did that feel?"    

Because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it,and you're going to get a much more interesting response.

### Number four: Go with the flow.    
That means thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind.       
### Number five: If you don't know,say that you don't know.        
> Err on the side of caution.    
> Talk should not be cheap.       
### Number six: Don't equate your experience with theirs.          
If they're talking about having lost a family member,don't start talking about the time you lost a family member.     

If they're talking about the trouble they're having at work, don't tell them about how much you hate your job. It's not the same.It is never the same.    

<b>All experiences are individual.</b> and more importantly,it is not about you     

### Number seven: try not to repeat youself.      

Don't Like that:![21st-conversation](/img/in-post/21st-conversation.png)        

### Number eight: Stay out of the weeds(废话).        
People don't care about the years, the names, the dates, all those details. What they care about is you. They care about what you're like,what you have in common. So forget the details.Leave them out.     


### Number nine: Listen.       
![Listen](/img/in-post/HT-talk2.jpg)        
我不听我不听我不听！     

> 程序媛：编译器！为什么我写的代码不通过。我检查了好多遍都没错，你是不是故意整我。负心汉， 愧我每天都和你玩，你就这么对我。55555555555555       

> 编译器：......! 不是，你听我解..释!    

> 程序媛：哼！我不听我不听我不听，你奏凯！     

> 编译器：不是，这个错误很简单，你看提示...    

> 程序媛：你是不是不爱我了，还是跟其它程序员好上了！ 负心汉，不和你玩了，（摔门而去！） 

> 这是一个关于不听的悲惨故事。     
      
### Number ten: Be brief.
